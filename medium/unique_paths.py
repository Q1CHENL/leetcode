# There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially
# located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The
# robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner
# (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either
# down or right at any point in time.

# Given the two integers m and n, return the number of
# possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the
# bottom-right corner.

# The test cases are generated so that the answer will be #
# less than or equal to 2 * 109.

# Excursion

# Divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming (DP) are both algorithmic paradigms used for solving problems,
# and they do share similarities, such as breaking problems down into smaller parts. However, they are
# generally considered to be distinct approaches due to key differences.

# Divide-and-Conquer:
# Non-overlapping Subproblems: Divide-and-conquer typically breaks the problem into non-overlapping
# subproblems. For example, in merge sort, the array is divided into two non-overlapping subarrays.

# No Memoization: Solutions to subproblems are usually not stored for future use.

# Recursion: This paradigm often makes heavy use of recursion to divide the problem into subproblems, solve
# each one, and then combine them.

# Dynamic Programming:
# Overlapping Subproblems: DP breaks problems into subproblems that often overlap. This is why memoization
# or tabulation is beneficial.

# Memoization/Tabulation: Solutions to subproblems are stored to avoid redundant calculations.

# Optimization: DP is often used for optimization problems where the best solution is sought, rather than
# just any solution.

# State Transition: DP often has a state transition relation that shows how to build up the solution to a
# problem based on solutions to smaller problems.

# Where They Intersect:
# There are some problems for which both paradigms can be applied, often resulting in different algorithms
# with different efficiency characteristics. For example, the Fibonacci sequence can be computed using a
# straightforward divide-and-conquer algorithm that has exponential time complexity, or it can be computed
# using dynamic programming to achieve linear time complexity.

# In summary, while divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming both involve breaking problems down into smaller
# subproblems, the methods they use and the types of problems they are applied to can be quite different.
